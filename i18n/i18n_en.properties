tMinesweeperDescription = Minesweeper is a logic puzzle game. The game features a grid of clickable tiles, with hidden "mines" scattered throughout the board.
tMinesweeperObjective = The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.
tMinesweeperGameplay = In Minesweeper, hidden mines are scattered throughout a board, which is divided into cells. Cells have multiple possible states:\n\n‚Ä¢ \u00A0Unopened tiles (cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n‚Ä¢ \u00A0Numbered tiles (can show 1-8)\n‚Ä¢ \u00A0Blank tiles (no mines are on the diagonal/adjacent to the tile)\n‚Ä¢ \u00A0Flagged tiles (appear after right-clicking an unopened tile)\n\nAn unopened cell is blank and clickable, while an opened cell is exposed. Flagged cells are unopened cells marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location. Flagged cells unopenable to reduce the risk of uncovering a suspected mine.\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile, and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. This may cause a chain reaction: any blank tiles opened by other blank tiles open the surrounding tiles too. Players can also flag a cell, visualised by a flag being put on the tile, to denote that they believe a mine to be in that place. Flagged cells are still considered unopened, and may be unflagged. When the number of adjacent mines is equal to the number of adjacent flagged cells, all adjacent non-flagged unopened cells can be opened by double clicking (regardless of if any tiles are mines or not).
